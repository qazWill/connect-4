# Gameplay
The game operates as your standard Connect 4 with tokens that drop to the closest empty spot in the column. After 4 in a row, a winner is declared. In case of a tie, a tie is declared. The game can be played against another human or an AI player. At the end of the game, moves can be replayed.
